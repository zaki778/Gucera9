This Project consists of 3 phases:
1-EERD and SCHEMA: EERD(Enhanced Entity Relation Diagram) of the project which classifies my entities of the project and the relation between them, SCHEMA maps this EERD to the relations(database tables).
2-SQL files: in which tables are created using sql server and some procedures are created to login for example
3-the frontend part of the web app using asp.net

P.S:
The main purpose of this project was to tackle the concepts of database (design phase (EERD) and sql) not really the asp.net part.
